\section{Development}

\subsection{Build Tool}

The program is implemented using the build tool Cabal (version 3.10.1.0) and GHC (version 9.2.5).
During development, the Haskell Language Server (HSL) (version 1.9.1.0) was used.

\subsubsection{Building}
The executable can be built by invoking the command \verb|cabal build|.
However, installing it with the command \verb|cabal install| is preferable as this approach enables the immediate execution of the program via the CLI.

\subsubsection{Running}

Running the program is possible by invoking \verb|cabal run|, or \verb|MiniCheck| if it was installed using \verb|cabal install|.
Appending \verb|--help| prints the help text.
The program has three modes, which are as follows:

\paragraph{minicheck validate TS\_FILE}
Parse and validate the transition system found at \verb|TS_FILE|.

\paragraph{minicheck ctl TS\_FILE CTL\_FORMULA}
Evaluate the CTL formula in the transition system found at \verb|TS_FILE|.

\paragraph{minicheck ltl TS\_FILE LTL\_FORMULA BOUND}
Evaluate the LTL formula in the transition system found at \verb|TS_FILE| with \verb|BOUND| as the maximum path length.
